# PacManProject

**Description**: Currently I am enrolled in a coding program through MITxPro, and this is a sample of some of my work. In this exercise we were provided with starter HTML and JavaScript code, and our goal was to fill in the missing code to get an image of PacMan to move back and forth across the browser screen. This was accomplished using four separate images that alternate depending on which direction PacMan in traveling. We also had to create boundaries that keep PacMan within the browser page while traveling back and forth across the page in a continuous loop.
